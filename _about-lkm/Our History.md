**Lembaga Khairat Muslimin (LKM)**Â was founded in 1952, during the British colonial era, when Singapore was part of the Crown Colony of the England. LKM then served as a self-help organisation within the SPF, overseeing the provision of basic religious educational and welfare needs of its Muslim officers and their family members.

LKM was, at one stage, administering over 80 madrasahs or religious schools for its members and their family members. With the closure of LKM's administered madrasahs, coupled with the many changes within singapore and the SPF since 1952, LKM proactively reviewed its mission, in order to stay relevant in a pluralistic and dynamic organisation like the SPF and the Home Team.
